# The Information-Entropy Framework (IEF)

## A Mathematical Foundation for Spacetime Dynamics

This repository contains the paper "The Information-Entropy Framework: A Mathematical Foundation for Spacetime Dynamics," which proposes a novel theoretical approach to understanding fundamental physics.

## Abstract

The Information-Entropy Framework (IEF) presents a rigorous mathematical formalization that proposes spacetime dynamics emerge from fundamental information processes governed by entropy principles. The paper demonstrates how the distribution and transformation of quantum information across different scales produces the observed properties of spacetime, including its emergence, dynamics, and expansion.

Through the derivation of a scale-invariant coupling function, the framework establishes how entropy production at different scales contributes to cosmic evolution, effectively unifying quantum, thermodynamic, and gravitational phenomena within a single mathematical framework.
